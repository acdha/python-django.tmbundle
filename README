Provides additional support for Django (Python) code files.
It is a fork of Paul Bissex's original bundle.


In addition to the model field support of the original bundle, 
this version adds:

 * More links to web resources
 * Form fields
 * URL patterns
 * view and "view for form" skeletons
 * view return (render_to_response, redirect, ...)
 * Middleware class skeleton
 * ...more to come...
